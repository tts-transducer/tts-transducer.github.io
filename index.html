		<p>We present audio examples for our paper <i>TTS-Transducer: End-to-end Speech Synthesis With Neural Transducer</i>. 
			To perform robust text-to-speech synthesis, we propose a TTS-Transducer model that can learn robust text and speech alignment 
            without modifying the model architecture or requiring ground-truth text duration. Experiments demonstrate that our alignment learning procedure improves the reliability of TTS synthesis, especially for challenging text inputs and outperforms prior LLM-based TTS models on both intelligibility and naturalness. 
            We present audio samples generated by TTS-Transducer model for both seen and unseen speakers.</p>

			<h3>TTS from Challenging Texts</h3>
			
			<p>
				We evaluate different LLM-based TTS models on a set of 100 challenging texts (Full list can be found <a href="challenging_texts.txt">here</a>) 
				For each text, we synthesize audios per model using speakers from the voice presets of the given models. The results of this evaluation are provided in Table 4 of our paper. We present some of the audio samples from this experiment below.

			<h3>TTS-Transducer Generated Audio using Different Codecs for Seen Speakers</h3>
			
			<p>
				In this section, we present TTS results when the reference audio is from a seen speaker and the text is from unseen holdout sentences. 
				We train TTS-Transducer Large on different audio codecs - Encodec, DAC and NeMo-Codec RVQ. We present the results on the holdout utterances from the Libri-TTS-R train-clean-100 set (seen speakers, unseen texts) below.

			<h3>TTS-Transducer Generated Audio using Different Codecs for Unseen Speakers</h3>
			
			<p>
				We also evaluate our models on the zero-shot TTS task, when the context audio is from an unseen speaker. We present audio samples generated by TTS-Transducer model for unseen speakers from Libri-TTS-R dev dataset. 
				We compare our two aligned TTS-Transducer Large model trained on 3 different audio codecs - Encodec, DAC and NeMo-Codec RVQ.
